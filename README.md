# Vaas Data Library
A library for automatically handling both file storage easily and mysql wrapper loading.

- This library will handle loading wrappers for the following modules:
    MySQL Storage:
        tmysql()
        mysqloo()
    File Storage:
        binarytable()
        
        
- Aswell this library also contains functions for handling mysql data without needing a binary module(but you will need to write your own handler with PHP or NodeJS. Security is also your responsibility. This may change but likely not for a while as I have no desire to bother with this rn.)
