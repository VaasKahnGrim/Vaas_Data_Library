# Vaas Data Library
A library for automatically handling both file storage easily and mysql wrapper loading.

- This library will handle loading wrappers for the following modules:
    - MySQL Storage:
        - tmysql(https://github.com/SuperiorServers/gm_tmysql4)
        - mysqloo(https://github.com/FredyH/MySQLOO)
    
    - File Storage:
        - binarytable(https://github.com/darkjacky/gm_binarytable)
        
        
- Aswell this library also contains functions for handling mysql data without needing a binary module(but you will need to write your own handler with PHP or NodeJS. Security is also your responsibility. This may change but likely not for a while as I have no desire to bother with this rn.)
